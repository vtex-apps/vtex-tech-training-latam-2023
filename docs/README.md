# APP NAME

Under the app's name, you should explain the topic, giving a **brief description** of its **functionality** in a store when installed.

Next, **add media** (either an image of a GIF) with the rendered components, so that users can better understand how the app works in practice.

## Configuration 

In this section, you first must **add the primary instructions** that will allow users to use the app's blocks in their store, such as:

1. Adding the app as a theme dependency in the `manifest.json` file;
2. Declaring the app's main block in a given theme template or inside another block from the theme.

Remember to add a table with all blocks exported by the app and their descriptions. You can verify an example of it on the [Search Result documentation](https://vtex.io/docs/components/all/vtex.search-result@3.56.1/). 

Next, add the **props table** containing your block's props. 

If the app exports more than one block, create several tables - one for each block. For example:

### `block-1` props

| Prop name    | Type            | Description    | Default value                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
| `XXXXX`      | `XXXXXX`       | XXXXXXXX         | `XXXXXX`        |


### `block-2` props

| Prop name    | Type            | Description    | Default value                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
| `XXXXX`      | `XXXXXX`       | XXXXXXXX         | `XXXXXX`        |

Prop types are: 

- `string` 
- `enum` 
- `number` 
- `boolean` 
- `object` 
- `array` 

When documenting a prop whose type is `object` or `array` another prop table will be needed. You can create it following the example below:

- `propName` object:

| Prop name    | Type            | Description    | Default value                                                                                                                               |
| ------------ | --------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------- | 
| `XXXXX`      | `XXXXXX`       | XXXXXXXX         | `XXXXXX`        |


Remember to also use this Configuration section to  **showcase any necessary disclaimer** related to the app and its blocks, such as the different behavior it may display during its configuration. 

## Modus Operandi *(not mandatory)*

There are scenarios in which an app can behave differently in a store, according to how it was added to the catalog, for example. It's crucial to go through these **behavioral changes** in this section, allowing users to fully understand the **practical application** of the app in their store.

If you feel compelled to give further details about the app, such as it's **relationship with the VTEX admin**, don't hesitate to use this section. 

## Customization

The first thing that should be present in this section is the sentence below, showing users the recipe pertaining to CSS customization in apps:

`In order to apply CSS customizations in this and other blocks, follow the instructions given in the recipe on [Using CSS Handles for store customization](https://vtex.io/docs/recipes/style/using-css-handles-for-store-customization).`

Thereafter, you should add a single column table with the available CSS handles for the app, like the one below. Note that the Handles must be ordered alphabetically.

| CSS Handles |
| ----------- | 
| `XXXXX` | 
| `XXXXX` | 
| `XXXXX` | 
| `XXXXX` | 
| `XXXXX` |


If there are none, add the following sentence instead:

`No CSS Handles are available yet for the app customization.`
